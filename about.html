                I'm Amanda, short for The Amazing Amanda.
                I'm a Parsons Design&Tech student & my intention as a Creative Technologist is to use electronic music
                to lead us to Edenism.
                This leads to my perpetual research on the aerodynamics of man vs. machine, and how the recording of the
                sound of machines comes into play.
                Expect a lot of my work to be blue.
                I also enjoy data visualization mostly through using my own biometric data as a Type-1 diabetic with
                wearable tech.
                My portfolio contains both my intellectual and emotional data, but words are flaccid and equations are sexy.</p>

            
            <p>Let X = Intellectual Quotient;</p>
            <p>Let Y = Emotional Quotient;</p>
            <p>Let Z = Amanda;</p>
            <p>X + Y = Z</p>
